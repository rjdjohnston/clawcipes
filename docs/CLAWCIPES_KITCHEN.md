# Clawcipes Kitchen (UI)

Clawcipes Kitchen is our UI for managing Clawcipes workflows.

## What it’s for
- Activity feed (high-level semantic events)
- Weekly scheduled-task view
- Global search across workspace + memory/docs + tasks
- Agent chat room
- Goals system (file-based source of truth)
- Approvals inbox + routing (e.g., Telegram)

## Status
Clawcipes Kitchen is under active development.

## Relationship to the plugin
- The **Clawcipes plugin** is CLI-first and works without any UI.
- Clawcipes Kitchen is an optional UI companion for:
  - visibility (activity/search)
  - approvals
  - human review of plans and changes

## Roadmap (high level)
- Approvals UI (approve/deny + audit trail)
- Recipe browser and scaffold flows
- Team dashboards (backlog/in-progress/done)
- Publishing workflow integration
